4 Eidos Scripts (Circular, Circular Smart movement, Random Grid, Random Grid Smart Movement), updated to output vcf,positions, use weighted position movement of offspring 

Will be merged to one script eventually, only keeping smart movement and controlling the total precentage of grids, with input sequence of integers controlling circuar or random shutdown (no layers).

test.eid is for testing code. Right now testing measuring of average genetic diversity between boxes (grids) / could be scrapped for out-of-simulation calculations.
